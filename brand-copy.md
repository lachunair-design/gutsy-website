## 1. THE FRONT DOOR (Home Page)

### Hero
* **Headline:** Most protein is clunky.
* **Sub-headline:** Standard plant molecules are too large for your gut to handle all at once. They sit there and ferment. This is why you feel like a parade float. We pre-break ours down so you actually feel light.
* **CTA:** Grab a bag (if you want)

### The Logic (Scrollytelling)
* **Panel 1:** Standard protein is a tangled molecular mess.
* **Panel 2:** Your gut has to wrestle with it for hours. That is where the bloat comes from.
* **Panel 3:** We use enzymes to snip those chains into tiny peptides first.
* **Panel 4:** It is called being pre-broken down. It is not magic. It is just better engineering.

### The Transparency Table (Amazing vs Less Amazing)
* **Amazing:** It actually dissolves. We pre-snapped the molecules into peptides.
* **Less Amazing:** The price. Clinical doses of Actazin® cost more than vanilla dust on Amazon.
* **Amazing:** Zero bloat. No "brick in the stomach" feeling.
* **Less Amazing:** It won't make you a hero. You still have to do the squats.

## 2. THE LOGIC (Science Page)

### Hero
* **Headline:** Actual Chemistry.
* **Sub-headline:** 16 facts about gutsy. minus the wellness theatre.

### The Full 16 Facts
1. **The Format:** Your old protein wasn't the problem. Its format was. Standard molecules are too large. They ferment. We changed the format.
2. **Hydrolyzed:** It is a cheat code for your gut. We pre-snap the chains so your body doesn't have to wrestle with them.
3. **The Blend:** Pea and rice together cover every amino acid. It is a complete protein that rivals whey. Yes, really.
4. **The Count:** 7 ingredients. Not 17. Most brands use gums to hide cheap materials. We skipped them.
5. **Actazin:** 600mg of New Zealand kiwifruit. It is a clinical dose that supports regularity. Not a marketing garnish.
6. **The Assist:** Kiwifruit contains actinidin. This enzyme continues breaking down the protein in your stomach.
7. **The Sweetener:** Monk fruit. Zero sugar. Zero glycemic impact. Used for a thousand years. It works.
8. **Heavy Metals:** We test every batch. Most brands hope you won't ask. We just show you the numbers.
9. **GMP Certified:** We use pharmaceutical grade quality frameworks. Not the "it is probably fine" method.
10. **The Failures:** 8 months. 47 formulas. This product is built on 47 failures and one stubborn question.
11. **The Ratio:** 23g of protein for 133 calories. Most people do a double-take when they see that ratio.
12. **The Vegan Truth:** No dairy tricks. No soy. Removing these variables removes the triggers for bloat.
13. **Blood Sugar:** Under 1g of total sugar. No spike. No crash. Just protein doing its job.
14. **The No-List:** No xanthan, no guar, no carrageenan. Better raw ingredients create fewer problems to fix.
15. **The Usage:** It is not just a shake. Use it in oats or yogurt. It doesn't go gluey when heated.
16. **The Planet:** Plant protein uses less land and water. Peas replenish soil. It is just common sense.

## 4. THE ACCIDENTAL BACKSTORY (About Page)

### Hero
* **Headline:** No boardroom required.
* **Sub-headline:** the accidental backstory.
* **Body:** GUTSY didn't start in a boardroom. It started because we were tired of feeling like we had swallowed a brick every morning. Two years ago we realized that most plant protein is just a heavy burden in a fancy tub. We were hitting our goals but our stomachs were staging a full-scale protest. We spent a year down a rabbit hole of lab reports to figure out why standard protein is so clunky. We found out the industry just assumes your gut is an industrial furnace. We used enzymes to pre-break those chains into tiny pieces before they ever hit the bag. No mystery fillers and no clunky molecules. Just a shake that actually leaves you alone.

## 5. HUMAN SUPPORT (Contact Page)

### Hero
* **Headline:** Customer Service?
* **Sub-headline:** this is the page for people who could not find protein-related answers elsewhere.

### The Categories
* Are you a bloated consumer looking for relief?
* A journalist who wants the real science?
* A human who wants to talk about molecular chains?

## 6. BORING ANSWERS (FAQ Page)

### Key Snippets
* **On Subscriptions:** We don't hide the cancel button behind a maze of phone calls. We want you to stay because you like the protein, not because you are trapped.
* **On Delivery:** We ship across the UAE. If you live in the middle of a desert dune reach out and we will see if we can find a camel that delivers.
* **On Quality:** Every batch is tested. No exceptions. We genuinely like the people who ask for the reports.

## 7. THE DEEP DIVE (Ingredients)

### Section: The No-Bullshit List
* **Introduction:** We only use seven things. If we couldn't explain their purpose to a fifth-grader, they didn't make the cut.
* **Actazin®:** New Zealand kiwifruit extract. It is the designated chaperone for the protein.
* **Monk Fruit:** A fruit that provides sweetness without the blood sugar drama.

## 8. SKEPTICS CORNER (The Reality Check)

### Section: Still don't believe us?
* **Copy:** We know. You have heard this all before. You have a kitchen cabinet full of "miracle" powders that just made you gassy. We are not promising a miracle. We are just promising better molecular engineering. If it still feels heavy, we will give you your money back. No awkward phone calls required.

## 9. SUSTAINABILITY (The Non-Preachy Version)

### Section: Doing less damage
* **Copy:** We use plants because peas and rice have a smaller carbon footprint than cows. It is not an activist statement. It is just math. We also use pouches because shipping giant plastic tubs of air across the ocean seems like a poor use of everyone's time.
