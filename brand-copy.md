## 1. THE FRONT DOOR (HOME PAGE)

### 1.1 Hero

- **Headline:** Most protein is clunky.  
- **Sub‑headline:**  
  Standard plant molecules are too large for your gut to handle all at once.  
  They sit there and ferment. This is why you feel like a parade float.  
  We pre‑break ours down so you actually feel light.  
- **Primary CTA:** Grab a bag (if you want)  

---

### 1.2 Quick Benefits Strip

_Appears directly under the hero._

- **Feels light, not like a brick.**  
- **Fewer, better ingredients. No gums.**  
- **Built to support digestion and regularity.**  
- **100% vegan, no added sugar, gluten free, dairy free.**

---

### 1.3 Simple “How It Works” (3 Steps)

_A simple explainer for skimmers._

1. **Standard protein = tangled chains.**  
   Most powders land in your stomach as long, clunky molecules your gut has to wrestle with for hours.

2. **We pre‑break the chains.**  
   We use enzymes to hydrolyze the protein into smaller peptides before it ever reaches your shaker.

3. **Your gut does less work.**  
   Smaller pieces plus Actazin® kiwi extract and no gums means a shake that dissolves, feels lighter, and is easier to live with.

---

### 1.4 The Logic (Scrollytelling)

_Panels or sections as you scroll._

- **Panel 1:**  
  Standard protein is a tangled molecular mess.

- **Panel 2:**  
  Your gut has to wrestle with it for hours. That is where the bloat comes from.

- **Panel 3:**  
  We use enzymes to snip those chains into tiny peptides first.

- **Panel 4:**  
  It is called being pre‑broken down. It is not magic. It is just better engineering.

---

### 1.5 Problem / Solution Strip

- **The Problem:**  
  Most protein shakes hit your stomach like wet concrete. Too many ingredients, clunky molecules, mystery gums, and a side of “why am I so bloated.”

- **Our Fix:**  
  GUTSY is gut‑friendly, pre‑broken down plant protein with Actazin® kiwi extract and no gums. Fewer, smarter ingredients built to feel light, dissolve easily, and leave your gut alone.

---

### 1.6 The Transparency Table (Amazing vs Less Amazing)

| Amazing | Less Amazing |
| :------ | :----------- |
| It actually dissolves. We pre‑snapped the molecules into peptides. | The price. Clinical doses of Actazin® cost more than vanilla dust on Amazon. |
| Feels lighter. No “brick in the stomach” feeling. | It will not make you a hero. You still have to do the squats. |
| Only 7 ingredients per flavor, no added fillers. | You might start expecting more from other things you put in your body. |

### 1.7 Risk‑Reversal / Guarantee Strip

- **Headline:** If it feels heavy, we give your money back.  
- **Copy:**

### 1.8 Who It’s For (Quick Snapshot)

_Short version on Home, full table lives on Product page._

- **For you if:**  
  - You like hitting your protein goals but hate feeling like a parade float.  
  - You have tried “clean” proteins that somehow still wrecked your digestion.  
  - You read ingredient lists and want fewer, better ones.  

- **Probably not for you if:**  
  - You want the absolute cheapest protein per gram.  
  - You are chasing instant miracles instead of consistent habits.  
  - You love that thick, gluey, dessert‑shake texture that comes from multiple gums.

## 2. THE LOGIC (SCIENCE PAGE)

### 2.1 Hero

- **Headline:** Actual Chemistry.  
- **Sub‑headline:** 16 facts about GUTSY. minus the wellness theatre.

---

### 2.2 Plain‑English Summary

Most protein is just nutrition in the wrong format. Big, tangled molecules, plus gums and fillers, force your gut to do overtime and often end in bloat.  
We changed the format: hydrolyzed plant protein, clinical‑dose Actazin® kiwi extract, and a short ingredient list so your stomach has less work and fewer random surprises.

---

### 2.3 Simple “How GUTSY Works” (Steps)

1. **Hydrolyzed protein:**  
   We pre‑snap long protein chains into smaller peptides so your body has less heavy lifting to do.

2. **Actazin® assist:**  
   600mg of New Zealand green kiwifruit extract, rich in actinidin, supports further protein breakdown and regularity.

3. **Fewer triggers:**  
   No dairy, no soy, no xanthan, no guar, no carrageenan. Fewer usual suspects your gut has to fight with.

4. **Tested and tidy:**  
   Every batch is third‑party tested for purity, heavy metals, and potency in a GMP‑certified facility, so what is on the label is what ends up in your glass.

---

### 2.4 The Full 16 Facts

1. **The Format:**  
   Your old protein was not the problem. Its format was. Standard molecules are too large. They ferment. We changed the format.

2. **Hydrolyzed:**  
   It is a cheat code for your gut. We pre‑snap the chains so your body does not have to wrestle with them.

3. **The Blend:**  
   Pea and rice together cover every amino acid. It is a complete protein that rivals whey. Yes, really.

4. **The Count:**  
   7 ingredients. Not 17. Most brands use gums to hide cheap materials. We skipped them.

5. **Actazin:**  
   600mg of New Zealand kiwifruit. It is a clinical dose that supports regularity. Not a marketing garnish.

6. **The Assist:**  
   Kiwifruit contains actinidin. This enzyme continues breaking down the protein in your stomach.

7. **The Sweetener:**  
   Monk fruit. No added sugar. Essentially no glycemic impact. Used for a thousand years. It works.

8. **Heavy Metals:**  
   We third‑party test every batch for purity, heavy metals, and potency. Most brands hope you will not ask. We just show you the numbers.

9. **GMP Certified:**  
   Made in Latvia in a GMP‑certified facility. Not the “it is probably fine” method.

10. **The Failures:**  
    8 months. 47 formulas. This product is built on 47 failures and one stubborn question.

11. **The Ratio:**  
    23g of protein in around 133–137 calories, depending on flavor. Most people do a double‑take when they see that ratio.

12. **The Vegan Truth:**  
    No dairy tricks. No soy. 100% vegan. Removing these variables removes the triggers for bloat.

13. **Blood Sugar:**  
    Under 1g of total sugar per serving. No spike. No crash. Just protein doing its job.

14. **The No‑List:**  
    No xanthan, no guar, no carrageenan. No added fillers. Better raw ingredients create fewer problems to fix.

15. **The Usage:**  
    It is not just a shake. Use it in oats or yogurt. It does not go gluey when heated.

16. **The Planet:**  
    Plant protein uses less land and water. Peas replenish soil. It is just common sense.

Vanilla Calm is a gut‑friendly protein shake that tastes like an actual treat, not a punishment.

#### Long description (PDP body)

Vanilla Calm is built for the “I love protein but hate feeling like I swallowed a brick” crowd.  
We took pea and rice protein, pre‑broke the chains down into tiny peptides, and paired them with 600mg of Actazin® kiwi extract and reishi mushroom so your gut does not have to wrestle with them for hours.  
No gums, no dairy, no soy, no added sugar, no weird aftertaste.  
Just a clean natural vanilla shake that dissolves easily, sits light at about 133 calories per serving, and lets you get on with your day instead of negotiating with your digestion.

### 3.3 Product Card – Cacao Boost

- **Title:** Cacao Boost  
- **Price:** 185 AED  
- **Badges:** Gut‑friendly · No added sugar · Gluten free · Dairy free · 100% vegan  

#### Short description (card)

For days when your brain and your gut both need a favor.  
Cacao Boost is a chocolatey, gut‑friendly protein shake that skips the jitters and the bloat.

#### Long description (PDP body)

Cacao Boost exists because “protein plus energy” usually means “plus chaos in your stomach.”  
We start with the same hydrolyzed pea and rice blend, then add real cacao, 600mg of Actazin® kiwi extract, and maca root.  
The result: a shake that actually mixes, feels light at around 137 calories per serving, and gives you a gentle lift without the crash or the brick‑in‑the‑stomach feeling.  
No gums, no dairy, no soy, no added sugar, and definitely no syrupy fake chocolate aftertaste.

- **Hydrolyzed base** for easier digestion and less post‑shake bloat.  
- **600mg Actazin® kiwi extract** to support digestion and regularity.  
- **Maca root extract** for a subtle “keep‑going” boost, not wired energy.  
- **Monk fruit sweetened, no added sugar,** real cacao for actual chocolate flavor, not “brown sweetness.”

#### Tastes like

A grown‑up chocolate milkshake that happens to have protein in it.

#### Best for

Post‑workout, late‑morning focus, or that “I could use a chocolate break but do not want to nap after” moment.

### 3.4 Usage / How‑to Section

**How to use it without overthinking it**

- **The simple version:**  
  1. Add 1 scoop (about 34g) to 300ml of cold water or your favorite non‑dairy milk.  
  2. Shake hard for 10–15 seconds.  
  3. Drink. Feel smug.  

- **If you want to get fancy:**  
  - Blend into oats or yogurt (it does not go gluey when heated).  
  - Add a banana, ice, and a spoon of nut butter for a full meal.  
  - Stir into coffee for a DIY iced mocha or vanilla latte situation.  

- **When you will notice it:**  
  - **Day 1:** Less “cement mixer” feeling after your shake.  
  - **Week 1–2:** A more predictable bathroom schedule for most people.  
  - **Ongoing:** Protein you do not have to mentally negotiate with.

_(Directions stay consistent with the label, just with extra personality.)_

---

### 3.5 Why This Bag Is Not 79 AED

We could have made this cheaper.  
We could have padded the tub with gums, cut the Actazin® down to “marketing sprinkle” levels, and hoped you did not notice the bloat.  
Instead, we pay for clinical‑dose kiwifruit extract, hydrolysis, and third‑party testing on every batch in a GMP‑certified facility.  
The result is a bag that costs a bit more, but also does not sit in the back of your cupboard next to all the other “miracle” powders you regret buying.

## 4. THE ACCIDENTAL BACKSTORY (ABOUT PAGE)

### 4.1 Hero

- **Headline:** No boardroom required.  
- **Sub‑headline:** the accidental backstory.

### 4.2 Story Body

GUTSY did not start in a boardroom.  
It started because we were tired of feeling like we had swallowed a brick every morning.  

Two years ago we realized that most plant protein is just a heavy burden in a fancy tub.  
We were hitting our goals but our stomachs were staging a full‑scale protest.  

We spent a year down a rabbit hole of lab reports to figure out why standard protein is so clunky.  
We found out the industry just assumes your gut is an industrial furnace.  

We used enzymes to pre‑break those chains into tiny pieces before they ever hit the bag.  
No mystery fillers and no clunky molecules.  
Just a shake that actually leaves you alone.

---

### 4.3 Who We Are (Really)

We are not legacy supplement people.  
We are people whose guts tapped out on standard protein, so we went looking for an option that did not wreck us.  
When we could not find it, we spent months annoying manufacturers, reading lab reports, and testing version after version until our stomachs finally stopped complaining.

---

### 4.4 What We Refuse To Do

- Add ingredients just to make a label look impressive.  
- Use gums to fake “creaminess” and then pretend we do not know why people feel bloated.  
- Hide behind buzzwords like “natural” and never show the numbers.  

If we would not drink it every day ourselves, it does not go in the bag.

## 6. BORING ANSWERS (FAQ PAGE)

### 6.1 The Goods

**Q: Is 20g of protein actually enough?**  
A: Yes. It is a complete protein with a PDCAAS score of 1.0. That means your body can actually use every gram. We do not do amino acid spiking or any of the other industry tricks used to inflate numbers on a label. If you are a 120kg bodybuilder you might need two scoops. For the rest of us, one is plenty.

**Q: Does it taste like “plants”?**  
A: Most plant proteins taste like a dusty field. We used real cacao and natural vanilla and then we hydrolyzed the base. Pre‑breaking the protein does not just help your gut. It also removes the beany aftertaste that usually requires a mountain of stevia to hide. It tastes clean.

**Q: How do I store this?**  
A: In the pouch. Zip it shut. Keep it in a cool, dry place below 25°C, away from direct sunlight. Best used within 2 months after opening. Do not leave it in a hot car in Dubai unless you want to find out what happens to monk fruit at 50°C.

---

### 6.2 The Logic (Science)

**Q: Why do I feel bloated with other brands?**  
A: Because their molecules are clunky. Standard protein lands in your stomach in long, tangled chains. Your gut has to wrestle with them to break them apart. While it is wrestling, the protein ferments. Fermentation causes gas. Gas causes the parade float feeling. We do the work first so your stomach does not have to.

**Q: What is the deal with the Kiwifruit?**  
A: We use 600mg of Actazin. It is a clinical dose of New Zealand green kiwifruit. It contains an enzyme called actinidin. Think of it as a secondary digestive system that helps break down the protein and keeps your bathroom schedule predictable. It is a tool, not a garnish.

**Q: Is it safe for people with IBS?**  
A: We built this specifically because we could not find anything that did not wreck our own digestion. We removed the gums, the dairy, and the soy. Those are the big three triggers. However, everyone is different. If you have a specific medical condition you should talk to a doctor who knows your history.

---

### 6.3 Logistics & Delivery

**Q: How fast is “fast” in Dubai?**  
A: If you order before noon, we usually try to get it to you by the next day. If you are in Abu Dhabi or the other Emirates, give us 48 to 72 hours. We move as fast as the couriers and the traffic allow.

**Q: Do you ship internationally?**  
A: Right now we are focusing on the GCC. If you are in London or New York and you really want a bag, reach out to us. We will see if we can make it happen without the shipping cost exceeding the price of the protein.

**Q: Can I change my subscription flavor?**  
A: Yes. You can swap between Cacao Boost and Vanilla Calm every month. You can also pause or cancel without having to talk to a customer service rep who is trained to make you feel guilty.

---

### 6.4 The “No‑List” & Skeptics

**Q: Why no xanthan gum?**  
A: Gums make shakes feel thick and creamy. They are also basically industrial glue for your intestines. They cause bloating in a lot of people. We decided a slightly lighter texture was a fair trade for not feeling like you swallowed a balloon.

**Q: Is it really “natural”?**  
A: That word is legally meaningless. We prefer the word Transparent. We show you our lab tests for heavy metals and we tell you exactly what every ingredient does. If you find something in the bag that should not be there, tell us. We will be just as surprised as you.

**Q: What if I hate it?**  
A: If it does not leave you feeling light, or if the taste is not for you, tell us. We will give you your money back on your first bag. We are not interested in keeping your money if you are not into the product.

---

### 6.5 The “Accidental” Stuff

**Q: Why 47 formulas?**  
A: Because the first 46 were not good enough. Some tasted like chalk. Some still caused bloat. Some did not dissolve. We stayed in the lab until we found the one that actually worked. It was a long 8 months.

**Q: Are you guys going to launch more products?**  
A: Maybe. But only if we find another category that is as clunky and broken as the protein industry. We are not interested in making me‑too supplements just to fill a shelf.

## 7. THE DEEP DIVE (INGREDIENTS)

### 7.1 The No‑Bullshit List

We only use seven things.  
If we could not explain their purpose to a fifth‑grader, they did not make the cut.

- **Pea Protein:** The main protein source. High in amino acids, gentle on most stomachs.  
- **Brown Rice Protein:** Completes the amino acid profile so it rivals whey.  
- **Actazin® Kiwi Powder:** New Zealand green kiwifruit extract. It is the designated chaperone for the protein.  
- **Monk Fruit:** A fruit that provides sweetness without the blood sugar drama.  
- **Coconut Milk Powder:** For creaminess without dairy or gums.  
- **Natural Vanilla / Real Cacao:** Actual flavor, not “vanilla‑ish” or “chocolate‑ish” aroma.  
- **Maca or Reishi (depending on flavor):** Adaptogenic support for days when life is doing the most.

(That is it. No glitter, no fairy dust, no unpronounceable stabilizers.)

---

## 8. SKEPTICS’ CORNER (THE REALITY CHECK)

### 8.1 Still Do Not Believe Us?

We know. You have heard this all before.  
You have a kitchen cabinet full of “miracle” powders that just made you gassy.  

We are not promising a miracle.  
We are just promising better molecular engineering.  

If it still feels heavy, we will give you your money back.  
No awkward phone calls required.

---

## 9. SUSTAINABILITY (THE NON‑PREACHY VERSION)

### 9.1 Doing Less Damage

We use plants because peas and rice have a smaller carbon footprint than cows.  
It is not an activist statement. It is just math.  

We also use pouches because shipping giant plastic tubs of air across the ocean seems like a poor use of everyone’s time.
